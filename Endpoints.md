# HTTP Endpoints

These are the API endpoints which need to be implemented:

| HTTP Method | Resource              | Description                       |
|-------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| GET         | /recipes              | Returns the list of recipes.      |
| POST        | /recipes              | Creates a new recipe.             |
| PUT         | /recipes/{id}         | Updates an existing recipe by id. |
| DELETE      | /recipes/{id}         | Deletes an existing recipe by id. |
| GET         | /recipes/search?tag=X | Searches for recipes by tags.     |
